The project files from Team Treehouse were stale.  

Inside the CSS, the fonts that were being used stopped working.  Boo.

I used a lesson learned from an earlier course on CSS to update the font with one that looked closer to the example in the video.  

I probaby could have found a closer match but I'm happy with this one.

## The CSS

```
font-family: 'M PLUS Rounded 1c', sans-serif;
```

## The HTML

```
