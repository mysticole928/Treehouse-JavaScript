# Team Treehouse - JavaScript Basics

These are my exercise files from the [JavaScript Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics) course from [Team Treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com).

When I did the Treehouse python course, I didn't really save the work I did.  I just completed the exercises and moved on. 

At the time, this was fine.  However, I'm an infrequent coder.  I enjoy it but it has not been part of my daily work life.  Instead, I code when I need to automate things.  I'll invest a ton of time on a project and then, when finished, won't look at it again until it breaks.

This means that, when something breaks, I have to spend far too much refreshing my memory.  

I have also learned that I don't enjoy creating code out of "whole cloth."  It helps me to have a template or two to use as a starting point.  So, I'm going to start saving my work here in github.

These exercise files are for my reference.  I hope, too, that anyone that stumbles upon them can use them to get through whatever is blocking their path.

There's no license attached these files nor is there any sort of warranty.  My code will not keep an airplane aloft nor will it keep a patient in a hospital alive.  It often does one thing really well.  (Sometimes, it does one thing but poorly.  I'm okay with that.)

Best of luck.  Also, remember to wear sunscreen, always use your turn signals (even when nobody is behind you), and when a child tells you a joke, always let them deliver the punchline.  (Even if you already know it.)
